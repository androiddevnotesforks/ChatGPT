        • In this mode, all messages in the conversation, including AI responses, will always be
        sent to the API when sending a new message. This way, the AI will be able to get the
        context of the conversation and respond as if it were a chat, like ChatGPT.
        \n• More tokens will be used over time, consequently increasing consumption on your account.
        \n• AI models have a token limit of 2048/4000. When receiving a maximum token limit reached
        error, it is recommended to clear the chat or start a new one.
    </string>
    <string name="search_mode_description">
        • Recommended if you want to use the AI to make isolated questions. With this you will
        not have a \"real chat\", but you will still have all the power of the AI for searches,
        text correction, translation or things like that.
        \n• Fewer tokens will be used than in Chat Mode, because with each request only the last
        message in the conversation is sent, causing less consumption on your account.
        \n• If you often face the problem of the AI responding incompletely, it is recommended
        to increase the maximum number of tokens in the conversation a little, as in this mode it
        is not possible to ask the AI to continue its response if the response is cut off.

        • Most capable GPT-3 model. Can do any task the other models can do, often with higher
        quality, longer output and better instruction tracking.
        \n• Recommended if you want more accurate and up-to-date responses.
        \n• Training data: up to June 2021.
        \n• Maximum support of 4000 tokens.

        • Very capable, faster and cheaper than text_davinci_003. However, it may present less
        accurate responses than the text_davinci_003 model, especially when it comes to
        programming codes.
        \n• Recommended if you want to have lower cost on your account.
        \n• Training data: up to October 2019.

    <string name="ai_model_option_max_tokens_description">
        • The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the AI\'s response.
        \n• Tokens are like pieces of words, where 1,000 tokens are about 750 words. This count can
        vary depending on the language.
        \n• A high number decreases the chances of cut responses, while a lower number may limit
        the AI\'s responses to a certain number of characters (tokens).
        \n• A number of 256 tokens does not mean that the AI will always use 256 tokens, but only
        that it can use that amount.

    <string name="ai_model_option_temperature_description">
        • What sampling temperature to use.
        \n• Higher values mean the model will take more risks. Try 0.9 to get more creative
        responses and 0 for more well-defined responses.
        \n• The closer to 1, the greater the chances of the AI responding differently to the same
        question.
